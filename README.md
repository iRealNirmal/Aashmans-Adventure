Aashmans-Adventure
==================

Description
Aashmans meaning is "Son of Sun". This game is a simple jump and run platform game with a style similar to Super Mario Bros and inspired by the Super Mario.
The goal is to reach the level end of level with the highest points by killing or saving own self from enemies.
This is the fight of the aashman for giving right to the poor as the enemies are coming forward to destroy the earth and nature. The various adventure will take you to the next level.
No Restart if kill by Enemy
Plus point of game is that you have 3 life to complete level. And you will not have to restart the game if enemy kills. Except you stuck in spikes, water or fall from edge of land.
It seems easy but with greedy approach it will be difficult but more enjoyable. So be greedy adventurer.
Currently it's in jungle world with 10 level.
